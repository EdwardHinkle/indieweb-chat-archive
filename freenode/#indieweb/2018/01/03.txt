E.g.\n * Something for the first time\n * Or the first time this year\n * Or build on something\n * Or complete something\n* Post about it on your own site,\n - or make a note of it and post it later.\n* *Before* posting anything negative or critical that same day\n\nFrom my experience last year, there were several times when for one reason or another I went days without posting, then had to \"catch up\". Instead of catch-up, I\u2019m making the posting part strictly secondary, and ok even if published days after the action.\n\nI expect to spend more time offline and perhaps even offgrid this year.
