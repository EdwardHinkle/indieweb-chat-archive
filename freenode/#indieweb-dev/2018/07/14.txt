I guess I am just not a fan of -x- in general. The mf standardising I think doesn\u2019t really help it either. It is no longer experimental when you get multiple consumers using it? So you specifically want live implementations grokking -x-something before dropping the -x-. Which is exactly what the RFC people have seen is problematic, because it is hard to get live implementations to change.","modes":["voice"]}
